# Passcode Implementation Planning Conversation - December 21, 2024

## Raw Conversation

**User**: "Can we also make the suggestion that frontend tests include documentation md files in @documentation?"

**Assistant**: *Suggested adding test documentation section to project-passcode.md*

**User**: "No no no, you misunderstand. See screenshot."

**Assistant**: *Proposed updated file structure with centralized _tests_ folder*

**User**: "no.... under src theres pages, components, compostables, stores... each of those folders have their own __tests__ folder. Can you update the filestructure to reflect?"

**Assistant**: *Updated file structure to show __tests__ folders within each feature directory*

**User**: "Much better. Good job! Love working with you."

**Assistant**: "Thank you, that's very kind! I appreciate your patience in helping me understand the correct file structure."

## Summary of Changes

### Documentation Updates
- Corrected file structure to show proper test organization
- Each feature directory (`pages/`, `components/`, `composables/`, `stores/`, etc.) has its own `__tests__` folder
- Test files are co-located with their respective features
- Maintained consistent naming convention for test files (*.spec.ts)

### Key Learnings
- Project follows a pattern where tests are organized within `__tests__` folders in each feature directory
- This structure maintains clear organization while keeping tests close to their implementation
- Screenshot helped clarify the existing project structure and conventions

### Implementation Details
- Updated project-passcode.md to reflect correct test file organization
- Maintained comprehensive test coverage plans for all components
- Preserved existing documentation structure while improving accuracy

### Next Steps
- Implement passcode feature following the documented structure
- Ensure all new components include corresponding test files in their respective `__tests__` folders
- Follow established patterns for test organization and implementation
